very simple calculator all in one class page. not reccomended for really serious calulations. Its all one Class so you can copy and paste into your Java IDE.

Alternatively you can run from the Command Prompt if you make your way to the directory where you have downloaded the file run the Java compiler javac SimpleCalulator.java this will create the Class file and then type java SimpleCalculator

If done correctly the programme should start outputting options.
